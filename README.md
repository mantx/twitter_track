=============

this is just a php test of job interview.

Description:

1. Currently only core features are implementes.
2. Also, a tiny web framework is implemented
3. integrated PHP Smarty Library into this tiny web framework to render the views
4. deployment utilities is not implemented, so SQL scripts with schema and seed data is in place, which can help to set up database, also .htaccess is ready to serve
5. a smarty-based view template work seemlessly with css and image resource file in the tiny web framework, but front end page is quite ugly, not a professional level.  
6. no ORM implemented, so there are pure SQL code inside model, please don't take it wrong way.
